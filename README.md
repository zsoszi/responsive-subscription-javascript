## What are you going to learn?

- Implement a responsive component

## Tasks

1. Implement your solution so it looks like the `mobile-design.jpg`.
    - The sites looks like the planned design when the screen width is less then 700 px

2. Implement your solution so it looks like the `desktop-design.jpg` when opened in a desktop browser.
    - The sites looks like the planned design when the screen is wider then 700 px
    - There is a "Sign up now!" hover message on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action button

3. Create a sign up form regarding the theme of the page. The form also have to be responsive.
    - When we click to the `Sign up` button, a form shows up
    - The form is fillable with name, birth date and billing address
    - When we click the `Submit` button in the form, it logs out the input values into the console

## General requirements

- The HTML elements are made with JSX

## Hints

- This project is based on [Single Price Grid Component coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc)
  on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) site.
- The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.
- There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
- A possible workflow:
  1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
  2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
  3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
  4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.


- Start the project by type `npx create-react-app responsive-subscription` in the terminal.
